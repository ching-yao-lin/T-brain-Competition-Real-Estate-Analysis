# T-brain-Competition-Real-Estate-Analysis
I attended a machine learning competition in July, 2019.
The goal here is to predict the price for each building.

Here are two files: 
The first one is about data exploration and creating plots using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. Please refer to Data Exploration.ipynb
The second one is where the model is trained, tested, and optimized. Please refer to Feature Engineering & Machine Learning.ipynb
